**DNA Sequence Assembly Project**

The DNA Assembly project is a Java-based application designed for assembling DNA sequences. This application simulates the process of assembling short DNA fragments into a complete sequence, a common task in bioinformatics and genomics.

**Project Structure**

Assembler.java: Contains the main logic for assembling DNA fragments. This class likely includes algorithms for sequence alignment and assembly.
Author.java: Provides information about the authors or contributors of the project.
Fragment.java: Defines a class representing a DNA fragment. This class may include attributes and methods relevant to a single DNA fragment.
FragmentTest.java: Contains unit tests for the Fragment class, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its functionalities.
AssemblerTest.java: Includes unit tests for the Assembler class, testing the DNA assembly logic and algorithms.

**Functionality**

DNA Fragment Representation: The Fragment class models individual DNA fragments, including their sequences and possibly other genomic data.
Assembly Algorithm: The Assembler class implements an algorithm to piece together these fragments into a full DNA sequence.
Testing and Validation: The Test classes ensure the reliability and accuracy of both the individual DNA fragments and the assembly process.

**How to Set Up**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
Open the project using a Java-compatible IDE.

**How to Run**
Navigate to Assembler.java to run the main assembly process.
To execute tests, run the test cases in FragmentTest.java and AssemblerTest.java using a Java testing framework.
